# snyk-coding-challenge

Hello :-) 

Thanks for the opportunity to code this task, it was quite fun!

Of course, because of the time constrains, it was a great challenge to decide what to focus on :-) 
I've placed a couple of comments in the code to show what I would do next. 
I'd, of cours,e on top of more tests and caching add logging as well. 

I've done the task in .net core 2.2, I hope that's ok :-) 
Hope you have fun going through it,

Cheers!
Agata
